- I'm Abra Ganz, a Master of Logic (student) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). Here you can find the projects I'm working on for university, and in my spare time.

- Currently studying Deep Learning and NLP. Particularly interested in the mathematical basis of machine learning; hit me up for some chat about geometric deep learning.
- Looking to collaberate on playful projects or theoretical research. If anyone is building a pun-generator, let me know!

- My LinkedIn is available on my profile. Get in touch!
